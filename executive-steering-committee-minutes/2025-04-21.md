## Summary:

* **New Member Introductions:**  Welcome new members Jeff Bibby, Senior VP of AI Strategy and Innovation, at Snyk and Dhaval Parekh, Senior Director of Product Security at Zscaler. 

* **Meeting Purpose:** David clarified that this meeting's purpose was to guide the agenda and prepare work items for the PGB at large, not to make formal decisions.  He  emphasized that the group would focus on direction and engagement, with final decisions made by the PGB.

* **Financial Update:** David reported that 11 of 12 premier members had agreed to pool dues, resulting in approximately $196,000 in pooled discretionary dues, with an expected total of $216,000.  He also mentioned upcoming emails regarding standing rules changes and a workshop for policy professionals.

* **Policy Workshop:** Sarah asked about the relationship between the proposed policy workshop and the public sector committee. David clarified that the workshop would focus on policy, while the PSC would focus on engagement with  standards bodies.

* **RSA Update and Event Engagement:** David opened a discussion on the effectiveness of CoSAI engagement at RSA and other events. Omar suggested that CoSAI currently lacks sufficient content to market effectively and recommended prioritizing tier-one events. Sarah added that providing guidance on regional and thematic focus would be helpful.

* **Workstream Progress and Investment:** David initiated a discussion on the progress of the workstreams. Omar suggested a broader CoSAI-level approach to supporting the to be donated SAIF tooling rather than assigning it solely to Workstream 3\. Sarah suggested that Workstream 3 might need individuals with more experience in the framework and risk assessment space. Omar suggested that successful transition and initial commits of the tool should be prominently marketed.  Geoff inquired about Workstream 3 end product, and David explained its goal to inform decision-makers about AI-related risks.

* **Non-Sponsor Engagement (OWASP and Beyond):** Omar provided an update on OWASP, stating that the agreement with OASIS is being finalized.Omar is working with the OASIS staff to finalize an Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or similar agreement for OWASP to join our TSC. This is the first time that we are onboarding a non-sponsor member to the TSC and the current agreement templates may need to be changed.  Additional sector and non-sector specific entities were discussed as future opportunities. David emphasized the importance of constructive engagement in selecting non-sponsors and avoiding groupthink.

* **Standards Engagement:** David opened a discussion on the progress of standards engagement, noting the lack of significant movement and suggesting a more focused approach with organizations like MITRE.  Omar suggested piggybacking on existing efforts like MTP and A2A to develop OASIS standards. David suggested refining the PSC's focus to increase traction. David emphasized the need for clear goals and making engagement easier for member companies.


### Next Steps and Actions:

* Finalize the agreement with OWASP targeted by the end of the week to secure their participation in the TSC.  
* Omar and David will resurrect conversations with the Cloud Security Alliance and report back to the ExSC and PGB.  
* David, Omar, and Jeff will refine the focus and goals of the Public Sector Committee (PSC) and propose them to the PGB.  
* Jeff and Nils will draft a concise statement outlining the PSC's focus on reinforcing and identifying opportunities for better AI security standards, aligning with CoSAI principles.
