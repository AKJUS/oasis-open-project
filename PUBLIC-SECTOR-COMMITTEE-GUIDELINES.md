# CoSAI Public Sector Committee (PSC) Governance

## Purpose
The purpose of the Public Sector Committee (PSC) is to define and document how CoSAI members and contributors engage and interact with in-scope standards bodies, civil society entities, and non-legislative government entities. 

The committee is responsible for developing and proposing the overall public sector engagement strategy and implementation including:
* **Engagement strategy**
  * Response to RFCs and other communication from in-scope entities (see [Scope of Engagement](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/new/main#scope-of-engagement))
  * CoSAI sponsored or co-sponsored outreach activities and events
  * CoSAI participation in in-scope entity sponsored activities and events
* **CoSAI Public Sector Scope**
  * Guidelines for the identification of global in-scope entities
  * Codification and maintenance of CoSAI’s primary domains of expertise
  * Engagement Responsibility Guidance: Who leads the engagement activity… CoSAI, an aligned forum, or individual board members
  * Guidelines for expected engagement activities
* **Public-sector Participation**
  * Selection of key activities and events
  * Coordination of PGB staffing of in-scope public sector engagements

### Scope of engagement
* **Non-Frontier Models:** Security questions and issues related to models that fall below the 10<sup>26</sup> flop threshold
* **Executive not Legislative:** Executive branch, standards bodies, and similar entities 
* **Outreach not lawmaking:** Responding to RFCs and related outreach looking for industry and expert opinion
* **Global Engagement:** Engagement with global organizations and entities in addition to US and European entities

## Participation and Chair
The PSC is a subcommittee of the PGB. Any PGB member or their alternate can join this committee, but no organization can have more than one vote.

The PSC is chaired by up to two of its members. The Co-Chairs are appointed by the PGB every two years by [Simple Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dSimpleMajority).

The **Co-Chairs** are responsible for:
* Scheduling, providing agendas for, and facilitating regular meetings
* Ensuring meeting minutes are posted to the MC mailing list following each meeting. (This may be done by the chair(s), OASIS staff, or by other committee members)
* Reporting on the PSC activities and progress to the PGB on a regular basis
* Making sure that the committee activities are aligned the with [overall purpose and mission of CoSAI](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/CHARTER.md)
* Creating a roadmap for producing the deliverables listed below.
* Ensuring that the deliverables are produced and published on Github.
  
## Decision making
All decisions are made by [lazy consensus](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/CHARTER.md). If consensus on an issue cannot be reached, the PGB should be consulted along with OASIS staff.

## Deliverables

The committee will establish the following proposals to support the full PGB’s ongoing engagement with the ecosystem:
1. Strategy for engagement with in-scope public sector entities
2. Key in-scope public sector entities (global) including engagement priority
3. Guidance for responding to out-of-scope queries and inbound requests
4. CoSAI public sector event participation and hosting guidelines
5. Engagement focus areas and plans for CoSAI’s year one in collaboration with the inaugural workstreams with an assessment of coverage against global (vs regional) outlooks.

All Deliverables of the Committee will be sent to the PGB for approval.

## Updating this document
All substantive changes to this document can be made by [lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html) of the PGB.
