* Next steps

## Summary

* Nils and Jeff led a discussion about the direction of the policy committee, emphasizing the need to focus on the benefits of CoSAI rather than advocating for specific policy points. The goal is to redirect conversations to the value of CoSAI, highlighting its open framework, diversity of voices, and the long tail of different organizations involved.   
* David emphasized the importance of engaging with non-corporate entities, such as government-funded organizations and regulators, and suggested presenting a framework for gauging the value and cost of these engagements to the board. He also proposed the idea of categorizing these entities based on their level of collaboration and engagement.   
* Daniel suggested incorporating feedback from external stakeholders into the workstreams to ensure their relevance and alignment with broader concerns. He proposes using engagement sessions as a way to gather diverse perspectives and identify potential blind spots or topics that may not be adequately covered.  
* Sarah mentioned that she and Marina have begun mapping out relevant groups and tailoring messaging for different audiences.  
* Nils suggested finding overlaps in policies across different jurisdictions to streamline the process.  
* The group discussed how to approach engaging with various government agencies and organizations. The key points are:   
  * Map out the specific groups they want to target and categorize them by focus areas like risk, regulation, cybersecurity, etc.  
  * Develop an approach for prioritizing engagements based on relevance to CoSAI's work streams.   
  * An initial document outlining the committee's scope, approach and priorities will be created to align the group.   
  * A "grid" listing the target organizations will be the first step, which Sarah and Marina will draft for the committee to review. 

## Next steps and action items

* Sarah and Marina to create and share an initial matrix of public sector groups and their areas of interest by next Monday.  
* Jeff and Nils to draft a document outlining the Public Sector Committee's focus, purpose, and approach.  
* All committee members to review and contribute to the shared matrix document once it's available.  
* David to present the Public Sector Committee's focus and initial plans to the PGB   
* PSC to revisit and update engagement strategies over the next 3-6 months  
* OASIS staff to schedule next PSC meeting in two weeks.
