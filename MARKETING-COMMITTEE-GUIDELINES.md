# CoSAI Marketing Committee Guidelines

The CoSAI Marketing Committee (MC) is responsible for promoting the mission of the Coalition by conducting official CoSAI-hosted marketing activities and by amplifying sponsor-hosted promotional activities related to CoSAI. The MC operates under the direction of the CoSAI Project Governing Board (PGB) with support from OASIS staff.

This document provides guidelines for CoSAI MC:
1. Participation and Governance
2. Activities
3. Official Resources
4. Funding
5. Media Relations

## 1. Participation and Governance
The CoSAI MC is made up of representatives from CoSAI Sponsoring organizations and non-commercial members of the CoSAI Technical Steering Committee. All Sponsors are encouraged but not required to have a rep on the MC, and there is no limit to how many representatives each organization may have involved.

All MC decisions are made by lazy consensus of the group. If consensus on an issue cannot be reached, the PGB should be consulted along with OASIS staff.

The MC is chaired by two of its members. Chairs are responsible for:

* Overseeing MC activities, ensuring alignment with CoSAI’s mission;
* Developing strategy plan for the MC;
* Scheduling, providing agendas for, and running regular meetings; 
* Ensuring meeting minutes are posted to the MC mailing list following each meeting. (This may be done by the chair(s), OASIS staff, or by designees.);
* Regularly reporting on MC progress and plans to the PGB;
* Conveying PGB directions to the MC members;
* Onboarding new members to the MC; and
* Helping staff ensure all Sponsors are engaged and fairly represented in MC activities.

## Chair Selection 
On an annual basis, all MC members will have the opportunity to nominate themselves for chair positions. OASIS staff will provide the PGB with a list of self-nominated candidates. The final selection of MC chair(s) will be made by the PGB via [Full Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dFullMajority).

Appointed MC chairs will serve one-year terms and may be re-appointed indefinitely.

In the event a chair resigns or becomes ineligible to serve mid-term, the PGB may opt to appoint a new chair to serve until the next annual nomination period or leave the position open, provided the MC has at least one serving chair. 

MC chairs must be employed by CoSAI Sponsor organizations. Chairs may retain their positions if they change employers, provided their new employer is a CoSAI Sponsor. 

## 2. Activities
The MC coordinates marketing and communications activities for CoSAI including:

* Media and analyst relations
* Events
* Social media outreach
* Website
* Blogs, videos, podcasts, etc.

There are two categories of CoSAI promotional activities: _Official CoSAI activities_ and _Sponsor-hosted activities_. 

### 2.1 Official CoSAI activities
These are promotional activities managed by the MC in cooperation with OASIS staff under direction of the PGB:

* **Planning and execution:** OASIS in collaboration with the MC is responsible for planning, organizing, and executing these events. This includes logistics, content, agenda, speakers, promotion, and overall coordination. 
* **Promotion:** The MC, supported by OASIS staff, develops content. Announcements and official collateral are issued/produced by OASIS on behalf of CoSAI. Sponsors contribute via the MC and individually may amplify and support promotional activities in ways defined by the MC.
* **Branding:** CoSAI is prominently featured as the host of the event. All sponsors are identified, with Premiere sponsors listed first, followed by all General sponsors, each category in alphabetical order. 
* **Speakers:** When needed, speakers or spokespersons will be selected by the PGB chairs and OASIS using the following criteria: a) expertise and neutrality of elected PGB, TSC, and workstream chairs; b)  desire to showcase the breadth and diversity of CoSAI support; c) equitable distribution of opportunities amongst Sponsors; d) individual’s domain expertise, availability, and other factors.
* **Funding:** When funding is necessary, it may be provided by OASIS, Premier Sponsor dues allocations, donations, barter arrangements, registration fees, or other resources appropriate to the activity. Coordination for funding will be managed by OASIS. 

### 2.2 Sponsor-hosted activities
These are conducted by individual Sponsors to promote their involvement in CoSAI. Sponsors are responsible for notifying OASIS and the MC to ensure accuracy and amplification of their activities. Examples of Sponsor-hosted activities include corporate blogs, corporate press releases that mention the company’s support for CoSAI, receptions, presentations in the company’s booth at conferences, etc.

* **Planning and execution:** The host Sponsor must notify OASIS and the CoSAI MC of their plans before announcing publicly. The Sponsor will be responsible for planning, organizing, and executing their activity, handling logistics, marketing, and coordination. 
* **Promotion:** The host Sponsor is responsible for developing its content and sharing it in advance with OASIS staff, who will review it for accuracy. The host Sponsor should notify the MC using the MC’s email list and tracking document. Other Sponsors may be invited to participate or amplify, but this is not required. 
* **Branding:** The activity may reflect the unique identity and focus of the Sponsor, allowing for more customized content and experiences that align with the Sponsor’s specific interests and goals. 
* **Speakers:** Where appropriate, the Sponsor may request speakers or other volunteers to support their hosted activity. The host Sponsor will be responsible for communicating these needs directly with the MC or to specific CoSAI Sponsors directly. Speakers or spokespersons may be selected at the discretion of the host Sponsor. 
* **Funding:** The host sponsor will be responsible for all expenses related to their activities. 

## 3. Official Resources
The following CoSAI resources are managed by OASIS and are subject to [OASIS’ trademark policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/trademark/) under the direction of the PGB and MC:

* Brand Assets: Logos, usage rules, and other guidelines
* Outreach Platforms and amplification strategy: Website, social media accounts, email marketing tools, GitHub, Slack and/or other social or CRM systems
* Content Creation: Internal and external copywriters, graphic designers, and video production teams (which we currently outsource)
* Media and Analyst Contacts: Drafting and distribution of press releases, briefings, etc.
* Research tools for tracking marketing performance, such as Google Analytics, social media insights, and SEO tools
* Event management resources for in-person and online events

## 4. Funding
**Core services**. Funding necessary for basic support of the Official Resources for CoSAI is provided by OASIS as part of its core services (which are funded by annual dues from CoSAI sponsors, both Premier and General). These include:

* Brand Development: Creation and maintenance of brand assets
* Web site hosting and maintenance
* Social media management
* Media and analyst relations 
* Logistics support for events
* Developer and Sponsor outreach

**Supplemental activities.** Activities not included in OASIS core services may be funded by Premier Sponsor dues allocations, donations, barter arrangements, registration fees, and other appropriate resources.  Examples of supplemental activities may include analyst-authored research, CoSAI-hosted developer conferences, professional video production, etc.

Each CoSAI Premier Sponsor has the option to designate a percentage of their annual dues to fund their choice of supplemental activities for CoSAI, subject to approval by OASIS and the PGB. Premier Sponsors may opt to combine their dues allocations to fund large activities that are overseen by the MC. 

Any Sponsor may offer to provide additional funding (beyond their dues) to underwrite the cost of a supplemental CoSAI activity. With approval from OASIS and the PGB, the Sponsor’s contribution may be appropriately acknowledged, however, funding cannot be used to secure special treatment contrary to the rules outlined in this document.

## 5. Media relations guidelines
CoSAI operates under the [OASIS Media Relations Guidelines](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/media-relations/). All Sponsors are advised to review and follow these guidelines when promoting CoSAI.
